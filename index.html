    <h1>Smarter Classrooms: Why IoT is More Than Just Automation</h1>
    <p><em>I recently had the opportunity to talk about IoT for classrooms, not just in terms of <span class="highlight">how</span> it works but <span class="highlight">why</span> it makes a difference.</em></p>
    
    <h2>How IoT Works (Quick Recap)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sensors</span> collect real-time data.</li>
        <li>The data is <span class="highlight">sent to the cloud</span> for processing.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Machine Learning (ML) algorithms</span> analyze the data.</li>
        <li>Insights are displayed on a <span class="highlight">dashboard</span> for decision-making.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
    <p>In our classroom, <span class="highlight">only 2 out of 4 tube lights</span> are turned on. Turning on the remaining two creates <span class="highlight">glare on the board</span>, making it difficult to read.</p>
    
    <h2>How Can IoT Help?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sensors can detect <span class="highlight">light intensity and reflection patterns</span>.</li>
        <li>Data is sent to the cloud and analyzed.</li>
        <li>The system suggests <span class="highlight">optimal lighting placement</span> for new classrooms.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Instead of blindly installing four tube lights in every room, schools can make <span class="highlight">data-driven decisions</span>â€”either reducing the number of lights or adjusting their placement.So my point was that IoT not only analyzes existing infrastructure but also provides valuable insights for future investments.</p>
    
    <h2>IoT: More Than Just Automation</h2>
    <p>IoT doesnâ€™t just monitor and automate; it provides <span class="highlight">data-driven insights</span> that help improve infrastructure and optimize decision-making. Schools can move beyond trial and error, making <span class="highlight">evidence-based upgrades</span> that enhance efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs.</p>
    
    <p>What are your thoughts on IoT in classrooms? Have you seen similar inefficiencies that technology could solve? Letâ€™s discuss! ðŸš€</p>
